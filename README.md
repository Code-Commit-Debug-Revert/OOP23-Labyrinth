# Labyrinth
Project repository for the development of a videogame version based on the board game "Magic Labyrinth".

## Proposal
Player view variants (to choose):  
+ First person (Hard),
+ Isometric(Very hard),
+ (recommended) From above(Medium).  

## Multiplayer management
+ Local (to think about it),  
+ Multi-client (Hard but funnier).

## Rules
+ Starting point: Standard "Magic Labyrinth" board game.
+ One player can't see the maze tiles until they are "explored" by him or by another player.  
+ Each player must "complete a quest" objective but first they need to find the right object to do it (if they want they can also steal another player's object and leave it the next turn).  
Generic meme example:  
"Goofy must capture the "homing pigeon" but to do so he will need a rifle."

## First idea: Objective briefing cards
+ **Objective**: The loan shark  
    "That bastard beat my brother, teach him a lesson!"  
    Requirements:                                       
    (baseball bat)                                     

+ **Objective**: Pimping pigeon  
     "GastÃ³n must understand what borders mean, we must  
     send a message. A clear message."                   
     Requirements:                                       
     (shotgun)  

## Second idea: Inserting special cards
For example:  
+ A tile that allow one player to rotate a "group" of tiles once chosen the perimeter to rotate (â­¯).  
+ A tile that allows you to teleport a player somewhere else (âœ¼).  
+ A tile that contain a musical challenge that gives buffs once completed successfully (ðŸŽœ).  
+ Etc...

## Extra
Implementation of the ability to choose the size of the game map.  

## The pros of choosing this project 
+ It's a very flexible project because it allows us to add new rules and features at will without too much added complexity.  
+ Easily modularized and decomposable problem.  
+ A good balance between originality and complexity of creation.  
+ Good chance of meeting deadlines and guaranteeing a good final product.  

## The cons of choosing this project
+ Multiplayer management.  
+ Creating patterns for map tiles and tokens.  
+ Create a good GUI
